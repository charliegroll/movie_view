movie-view
==========

This is a personal project built on *Django* and displayed with *Twitter Bootstrap* that aims to create an auto-updating site to view a file system of movie files.

It uses the *TMDB* api to look up movie information, and will give a reactively-designed web view of my movie/TV collection by recursively reading through the files in the Movies directory.

To-Do:

[ ] Maybe a database or just do the data file better
[ ] Beamer needs the correct file names... store those or update the filenames as results come back
[ ] Add ability to open items in "Not Found" list
